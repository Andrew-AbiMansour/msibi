This directory contains several tests.
It is advisable, at the minimum, to run the LJ test to make sure the
code works as expected.

LJ : recover known LJ potential
    - This test, as described in the original paper, is recovering a
      known potential to show that the methodology works. The target
      data was derived from LJ fluids at three different states.

PROPANE : recover known propane potential
    - This test, as described in the original 2014 paper, is recovering a
      known potential to show that the methodology works. The target
      data was derived from propane at three different states.
